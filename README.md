## Avaliable Scripts
* Environment Setup
    * Start PostgreSQL server for WSL: sudo service postgresql start

* Fork and clone our [repository](https://github.com/conniedc1206/book-club-cafe-app) onto your local environment:
    * Install the dependencies by running: bundle install & npm install --prefix client
    * In the project directory, you can run the app in the development mode: 
         * create db: rails db:create
         * run migrations and seed data: rails db:migrate db:seed
         * run servers: npm start â€“prefix client & rails s (in a separate terminal)
         * This will run your server on port http://localhost:4000. Check it out in the browser to make sure your server works!
